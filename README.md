### What I learned

For this project, I spent time setting up a stronger foundation for the styling in CSS, making sure the layout and overall look felt clean and consistent from the start. I also chose to rely heavily on plain JavaScript to handle the functionality, which gave me a good chance to practice writing everything from scratch without depending on frameworks. This approach helped me strengthen my understanding of core web development concepts while keeping the project lightweight and straightforward.

```css
:root {
  --clr-white: 0 100% 100%;
  --clr-black: 0 0% 0%;
  --clr-blue-950: 218, 23%, 16%;
  --clr-blue-900: 217, 19%, 24%;
  --clr-blue-600: 217, 19%, 38%;
  --clr-blue-200: 193, 38%, 86%;
  --clr-green: 150, 100%, 66%;

  --ff-sans: 'Manrope', sans-serif;
}

body,
html {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  background-color: hsl(var(--clr-blue-950));
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100%;
}

*,
*::before,
